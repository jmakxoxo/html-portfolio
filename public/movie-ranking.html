<h1>The Best Series According to Jen</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 for 2023</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Patient</h3>
<p>A great thriller analyzing a sociopath but also about self reflection</p>
<h3>Fleishman is in Trouble</h3>
<p>A mini series about real life. It touches on topics that are somewhat taboo to
speak about: midlife crisis, childhood traumas and how they effect your exeryday
life, the problems of society, expectations of women, mental issues.</p>
<h3>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</h3>
<p>A hilarious take on how life was in the 1950s and 60s.</p>
